"""Discovery and parsing of Dependabot cooldown configuration.

GitHub Dependabot supports a ``cooldown`` stanza that delays opening
dependency-bump pull requests until a release has been available for a
minimum number of days. This guards against supply-chain attacks and
hastily-retracted releases.

This module locates the repository's ``.github/dependabot.yml`` (or
``.yaml``) file by walking up the directory hierarchy from a starting
path, then extracts the ``cooldown.default-days`` value so the linter can
apply the same policy when updating action calls.
